1. Introduction:

Java is a programming language and platform independent language.
Java is a secure, high level, object oriented language.
Java is developed by Sun Microsystem in 1995.
James Gosling is a father of Java.
First name of java is Oak. But Oak is already registered company then name changed to java.
Java can able to run in any platform using JRE(Java Runtime Environment).

2. Applications:

Desktop Applications
Web Applications
Enterprise Applications (Eg: Banking application)
Mobile Applications
Embedded System
Robotics
Game Development

3. Java platform/edition:

Java SE(Java Standard Edition): It includes API such as java.io, java.lang, etc... and OOPS and core concepts implementations.
Java EE(Java Enterprise Edition): It is used to develop web and enterprise applications.
Java ME(Java Micro Edition): It is used to develop mobile applications.
JavaFX: It is lightweight user interface API and used to develop desktop applications.

4. Features:

(i) Simple:

Java is simple programming language and esay to learn.
Java syntax is based on C++.
There is no need to remove unreferenced object beacuse java has Automatic Garbage Collection

(ii) Object-Oriented:

Java is an object-oriented programming language.
We organize our software as different objects, it will handle both data and behaviour.
basic OOPS concept such as Object, Class, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation.

(iii) Platform independent:

Java can able to run in any platforms using JVM(Java Virtual Machine).

(iv) Secure:

We develop virus-free system using Java. 
Java is secured because no explicit pointer and java run inside virtual machine sandbox.
Classloader: It is part of JRE. It load java class into JVM dynamically.
Bytecoder verifier: It check the code fragments for illegal code.
Security manager: It handle access for read and write to the localdisk.

(v) Robust:

It uses strong memory management.
It provide automatic garbage collection which run on JVM.

(vi) Architecture-neutral:

Java is architecture neutral because there is no implementation dependent feature. 
Size of primitive types is fixed.
Eg: In C, int datatype occupies 2 bytes in 32 bits and 4 bytes in 64 bits. However in Java, 4 bytes for both 32 and 64 bits.

(vii) High performance:

Java is an interpreted programming language.
Java is faster than other interpreted programming language.
But Java is little bit slower than other compiled language.

(viii) Multithread: 

Java execute separate program in concurrently.
It doesn't occupy memory for each thread because it shares common memory area for thread.

(ix) Thread:

Java is dynamic language.
It support dynamic loading of classes.

5. JVM, JRE, JDK

JVM, JRE, JDK are platform independent.

(i) Java Virtual Machine (JVM):

It provide runtime environment which is used to execute Java bytecode.
Main task of JVM is Load code, verify code, execute code, provide runtime environment.

(ii) Java Runtime Environment(JRE):

It is also known as RTE.
JRE is set of software tools to develop java applications.
It is the implementation of JVM.
It contains set of libraries + other file that JVM uses at runtime.

(iii) Java Development Kit(JDK):

It is a software development environment which is used to develop java applications.
It contains JRE+Development tools.
